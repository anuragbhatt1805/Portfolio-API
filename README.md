## üõ†Ô∏è Tools for Development
<div align="justify">

 - <strong>Django:</strong> <em>Django serves as the robust web framework at the core of our project, offering a high-level, Python-based development experience. With its batteries-included philosophy, Django streamlines the creation of web applications, ensuring scalability and maintainability.</em>

 - <strong>Django Rest Framework:</strong> <em>Building upon Django, Django Rest Framework (DRF) extends the capabilities to effortlessly craft RESTful APIs. DRF provides a toolkit for handling serialization, authentication, and viewsets, making API development in Django a seamless process.</em>

 - <strong>Version Control (Git):</strong> <em>Git facilitates collaborative development, allowing multiple developers to work on the project simultaneously. It enables versioning, branching, and merging, ensuring a well-organized and controlled development process.</em>

 - <strong>Postman:</strong> <em>Postman plays a crucial role in our development workflow, serving as more than just an API documentation tool. It enables the creation and testing of API requests, allowing for efficient collaboration, testing, and documentation. Postman's user-friendly interface ensures a smooth experience for developers working on API endpoints.</em>
